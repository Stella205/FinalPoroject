<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Our team is a very select team, and quite difficult to get on.
 To find a young team who stays off their cell phones while at work,<br>who works extremely hard and efficiently, 
 who work to make every single plate Instagrammable,<br> and who are super friendly with customers is almost impossible...
 but we found it! To top it off each team MUST believe<br> in giving back to the community and helping others. 
 We are not perfect, but we hire good humans with old school work ethic,<br> and who simply love to hand over delicious food.</p>

     <h3>Support our Troops</h3>
     <p>You may notice a military theme among us. We believe in supporting those that work hard to keep us safe!<br>
         These people put their lives and families on the front line, and often go unappreciated.<br>
        We give back to the military, specifically our veterans and and those in need through the Legion and the MFRC.<br> We certainly support our troops, and are very thankful for their efforts. </p>
